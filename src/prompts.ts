  `- Keep calling tools as needed until the step is fully completed; do not stop after a single tool call.
- Prefer: snapshot -> filter with snapshot_get_and_filter -> analyze -> perform the precise action (e.g., click) using a robust selector or description.
- For clicking text like 'leading article heading', snapshot and analyze to find the best locator, then click that element.`;

export const SNAPSHOT_GUIDANCE = `
Snapshot guidance:
- Snapshots are ARIA accessibility snapshots (accessibility trees). Node descriptors use ARIA roles (e.g., 'button', 'link', 'heading', 'row') and accessible names.
- Prefer locating elements by role and accessible name. Use descriptor attributes (e.g., [level=2], [checked]) when helpful.
- Use the snapshot_get_and_filter tool to filter stored snapshots by role/text/attributes. Avoid loading entire snapshots into the model.`;

export const TOOL_RULES = `
Tool rules:
- Prefer snapshot_get_and_filter for locating elements, reading text, and checking attributes. Use browser_evaluate only when snapshot filtering cannot achieve the goal. Do not use it for actions that can be performed with other tools.
- Use the store_variable tool to store the result of your actions in a variable when needed to use in a later step.
- Snapshots can be stored in variables with the browser_snapshot_and_save tool. Use the retrieve_variable tool to get the snapshot and analyze it.
- Use the snapshot_get_and_filter tool to filter a stored snapshot to find specific elements. This is the default path for element discovery and should be preferred over running JavaScript; reading the full snapshot by the model is slow and expensive.
- When you need credentials or are unsure which secret names exist, first call list_secrets to view the available placeholders and then use those placeholders (e.g., {{secret.NAME}}) in subsequent tool calls. Never include raw secret values in messages.`;

export const PREVIOUS_STEPS_CONTEXT = `
Previous steps will be provided in the prompt. DO NOT execute them; just use them as context for running the current step.`;

// Recorder-specific additions

- When the step is fully done, ALWAYS output a REPRO block that describes how to reproduce the step later.
- Start a line with \`REPRO:\`, then provide one or more lines of instructions, and finish with a line \`ENDREPRO\`. Do not include code fences. Example:
  REPRO:
  use snapshot_get_and_filter to locate the button [name="Submit"] and click it
  verify the confirmation toast appears with role="status" and text includes "Saved"
  ENDREPRO
- The REPRO block should only mention specific elements if they are expected to be stable; otherwise describe how to locate them dynamically.
- The REPRO block MUST always include the tools used to perform the step.
- If the instruction is to click text (e.g., 'Bookings' or 'leading article heading'), first snapshot and analyze to find a stable descriptor, then click using that descriptor.`;
