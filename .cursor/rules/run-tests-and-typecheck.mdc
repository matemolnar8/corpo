description: Always run type check and tests after TypeScript changes using project tasks

# TypeScript changes require type-check and tests

Whenever you make a substantive edit to TypeScript files, do both of the following:

- Type-check the project quickly without executing tests:

```bash
deno check
```

- Run the full test suite:

```bash
deno task test
```

Project tasks are defined in [deno.json](mdc:deno.json). Use the run terminal command tool to execute these commands non-interactively.
